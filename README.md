# ABCD-ReproNim Course Project Proposals
Tracking and managing project proposals for the ABCD-ReproNim course's 2020 project week.

## Contributing

The ABCD-ReproNim course's project week is limited to students with a valid data use certification (DUC) for the ABCD dataset.

However, you can propose a project long before the project week, and even before you have a DUC, as long as you are an enrolled student or an observer student who has been invited to participate in Project Week.

To propose a project, open an issue with the "Propose project" template or [click here](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues/new/choose).
There will be instructions for filling out the template.
Don't worry about having a fully fleshed-out analysis plan or anything- the project proposal issues are for _initial_ plans.

If you find yourself overwhelmed by the template, please look at [our example proposal](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues/2).

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your ideas. No, really. Project proposals can always be tuned and improved over time, so please feel free to open an issue for your idea.

## Code of Conduct

We want all students to feel welcome when participating in conversations.
Please have a look at the ABCD-ReproNim course's [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQf9aEggUlwIlft8mVGC1mdMjiJVWF4RDnnVGWKvfo8/edit?usp=sharing).
