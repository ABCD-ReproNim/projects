Tracking and managing project proposals for the ABCD-ReproNim course's 2020 project week.

## Contributing

The ABCD-ReproNim course's project week is limited to **enrolled** students with a valid data use certification (DUC) for the ABCD dataset.

However, you can propose a project long before the project week, and even before you have a DUC, as long as you are an enrolled student.

To propose a project, open an issue with the "Propose project" template.
There will be instructions for filling out the template.
Don't worry about having a fully fleshed-out analysis plan or anything- the project proposal issues are for _initial_ plans.
